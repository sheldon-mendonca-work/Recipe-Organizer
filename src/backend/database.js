        ingredients: "chicken stock, saffron, salt, olive oil, onion, pepper rice, tomatoes, garlic, shrimp ",
        instructions: `
        1. Heat a gas grill to medium-high heat (375°F), or light a charcoal grill and let burn until the charcoal is covered with gray ash.
        2. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the stock to a boil. Add the saffron and salt. Turn off the heat and let the saffron steep for at least 15 minutes. Taste and add more salt, if needed.
        3. In a 12- to 14-inch stainless steel skillet or cast iron pan, heat the oil over medium heat on top of the stove. Add the onion and red pepper, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Stir in the garlic and chorizo.
        4. On a table next to the grill, set the skillet with the sofrito, the rice, tomatoes, infused stock, salt, peas, shrimp, mussels, and clams.
        5. Set the skillet with the sofrito on the grill. Add the rice, and cook, stirring often, for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the rice is coated with oil and lightly toasted.
        6. Nestle the mussels and clams into the rice with the hinge sides up so they release their juices into the rice. Arrange the shrimp around the shellfish.
        7. Slip a spatula under the rice and check to see if you have achieved the elusive golden brown socarrat. If not, set the pan over the heat, uncovered, for a few minutes to lightly caramelize the bottom.

        ingredients: "Sushi Rice, Sushi Vinegar, Wasabi, Pickled Ginger, Soy Sauce, Eel Sauce, Nori Seaweed Sheet, Sharp Knife",
        instructions: `1. Cook the Sushi Rice: Wash and rinse the rice with cold water. Add the rice and water to the rice cooker. Cook according to the instruction.
        2. Season the Rice: Transfer the rice to a large bowl and let it cool down slightly. When it's still very warm, stir in the sushi vinegar (or the mixture of rice vinegar and sugar).
        3. Prepare the Topping: If you use raw fish, cut it against the grain, with an angle of 30 to 45 degrees. I recommend cutting it to 3-inch long, 1-inch wide, and 1/4-inch thick pieces. (You'll need to adjust the angle from time to time to get the proper length and thickness.) If you make tamago nigiri, you'll need to cook the egg first. See this post for details.
        4. Shape the Rice: Place about 3 tablespoons of rice in your hand. Squeeze it together until it rolls into a firm oval shape. Make the bottom flat with the rounded top. (You can dip your hand in tezu water to prevent sticking.)
        5. Assemble the Nigiri: Place the fish, egg, or veggie slice on the root of your fingers. Then take a pea-sized portion of wasabi, and spread it in the middle of the slice.`

        ingredients: "bread, milk, oil, onions, herbs, curry powder, cumin, turmeric, garlic, chicken, jam, salt",
        instructions: `1. Preheat your oven to 350°F.
        2. Soak the bread in 1 cup of milk.
        3. Heat the olive oil in a wide skillet set over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the onions, and cook until soft.
        4. Add the curry powder, mixed herbs, ground cumin, turmeric, and garlic, and stirring constantly, allow to cook for a minute or two until the garlic is soft.
        5. Add the ground chicken, and cook, stirring frequently to break up any big chunks, until browned.
        6. Once the chicken is browned, remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the chutney, apricot jam, all the lemon zest, half the lemon juice, tomato paste, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well, give it a taste, and add more lemon juice, salt, and pepper as desired. It should be delightfully zingy!
        7. Squeeze the milk from the bread, reserving the milk for later, and smooshing and tearing the bread into small pieces. Mix the bread into the chicken mixture, and spread evenly into an oven-proof dish.
        8. Strain the milk that has come from the bread, and add the remaining 1/2 cup of milk. Beat in the eggs, and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Pour this over the meat, and decoratively scatter the bay leaves on top.
        9. Bake, uncovered, at 350°F for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.`

        5. Add rice, 2 tbsp kecap manis and shrimp paste, if using. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes until sauce reduces down and rice grains start to caramelise (key for flavour!).
